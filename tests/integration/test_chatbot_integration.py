class TestIntegrationScenarios:
    """
    A test suite for evaluating the integrated behavior of the VoiceAssistant, focusing on its ability to
    dynamically and contextually interact with users. This includes accurately detecting sentiments,
    incorporating relevant feedback based on ongoing interactions, and adapting responses according to the
    conversational context and user's emotional state.

    These tests ensure that the VoiceAssistant can:
    - Accurately detect and interpret the sentiment expressed in user inputs.
    - Identify whether a feedback inquiry is appropriately included in the assistant's responses.
    - Manage a sequence of interactions effectively, applying correct sentiment analysis and
      generating contextually appropriate feedback inquiries, simulating realistic user interactions.

    This suite is crucial for validating the integration of sentiment analysis, feedback mechanisms,
    and overall conversational logic in scenarios that mimic real-world usage, ensuring the assistant's
    reliability and accuracy in user interactions.
