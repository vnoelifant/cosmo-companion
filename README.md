# Cozmo: A Caring, Emotionally Intelligent Robot

This goal of this project is to program Cozmo, a small, interactive robot developed by Anki, into a caring, emotionally intelligent robot companion and assistant using multimodal emotion recognition capabilities. The following tools and features are planned: 

  * [Cozmo Python SDK](http://cozmosdk.anki.com/docs/index.html) with built-in facial expression estimation
  * PyAudio for speech recording
  * [Watson Developer Cloud Python SDK](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/python-sdk) for speech to text service
  * [GPT-4](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4) for multi-turn conversational dialogue flow, text sentiment analysis, and enhancing conversational responses based on sentiment
  * Facial Emotion Recognition using Cozmo's [estimate_facial_expression feature] (https://developer.anki.com/vector/docs/generated/anki_vector.robot.html)
  * Real-time emotion recognizer based on acoustic properties of speech using the tool [emoVoice](https://github.com/hcmlab/emovoice) 

  * **Bonus**: Emotion recognition based on physiological signals processed from [SSI (Social Signal Interpretation)](https://github.com/hcmlab/ssi) framework

The target audience is intended to be all people who want a companion, entertainment, or a support system during difficult times.
