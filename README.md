# Cozmo: A Caring, Emotionally Intelligent Robot

This goal of this project is to program Cozmo, a small, interactive robot developed by Anki, into a caring, emotionally intelligent robot companion and assistant using multimodal emotion recognition capabilities. The following tools and methods are planned to be integrated:

  * [Cozmo Python SDK](http://cozmosdk.anki.com/docs/index.html) with built-in facial expression estimation
  * PyAudio for speech recording
  * [Watson Developer Cloud Python SDK](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/python-sdk) for speech to text and dialogue flow services
  * Custom Built Speech Emotion Recognizer using Python's Keras library and Librosa audio analysis package
  * GPT-4 (on the waitlist as of 4/12/23)
  * Text Sentiment Analysis using Python's NLTK
  * Emotion recognition based on physiological signals 

The target audience is intended to be all people who want a companion, entertainment, or a support system during difficult times.
