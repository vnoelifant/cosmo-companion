# Cozmo: A Caring, Emotionally Intelligent Robot

This goal of this project is to program Cozmo, a small, interactive robot developed by Anki, into a caring, emotionally intelligent robot companion and assistant using multimodal emotion recognition capabilities. The following tools and features are planned: 

  * [Cozmo Python SDK](http://cozmosdk.anki.com/docs/index.html) with built-in facial expression estimation
  * PyAudio for speech recording
  * [Watson Developer Cloud Python SDK](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/python-sdk) for speech to text and dialogue flow services
  * Custom-Built Speech Emotion Recognizer written in Python, using [Keras](https://keras.io/about/library) Deep Learning library and [Librosa](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html) audio analysis package
  * [GPT-4](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4) (on the waitlist as of 4/12/23)
  * Text Sentiment Analysis using Python's [NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)](https://www.nltk.org/)
  * Additional Machine Learning tools via [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
  * **Bonus**: Emotion recognition based on physiological signals processed from [SSI (Social Signal Interpretation)](https://github.com/hcmlab/ssi) framework

The target audience is intended to be all people who want a companion, entertainment, or a support system during difficult times.
